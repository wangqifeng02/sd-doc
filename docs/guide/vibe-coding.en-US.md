## LLMs.txt

To make tools like Cursor and Claude Code understand Spark Design, we support LLMs.txt files, making Spark Design's documentation available for large language models.

- [index.llms.txt](https://g.alicdn.com/code/npm/@ali/agentscope-ai-design/4.7.2/docs-dist/llms/index.llms.txt): The main LLMs.txt index file
- [all.llms.txt](https://g.alicdn.com/code/npm/@ali/agentscope-ai-design/4.7.2/docs-dist/llms/all.llms.txt): Complete documentation for Spark Design

Use the @Docs feature in Cursor to include the LLMs.txt files in your project. [Read more](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/@-symbols/@-docs)

## D2C

With Alibaba Cloud Spark Design, Spark Design design suite and cursor rules, generating code from masterGo visual designs can achieve the following:

- Accurate icon identification
- Use of standard CSS tokens
- No need to measure spacing, rounded corners and other data - AI directly restores layout (90%+ accuracy)
- Use standard components to restore pages, most standard components can be generated correctly in one go without secondary adjustments

We will soon release the masterGo design suite and rules to help you efficiently restore visual designs.
